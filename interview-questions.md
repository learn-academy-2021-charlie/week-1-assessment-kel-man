# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a series of rules that handle incoming information to produce a specific output. You would use one to map out behavior for your program.

  Researched answer:



2. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  Your answer: I'm not entirely sure, but I believe an argument is the data you pass into a function, whereas a parameter is data a function is using that was passed into it? Otherwise they are the same thing.

  Researched answer:



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is a location within an array. It accesses a specific node and nothing else. A value is a piece of data stored somewhere. A value could be stored at an index within an array, but they are two different types of speech in javascript.

  Researched answer:



4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: A built-in method is a function that is built-in to whichever respective class it is a part of, be it string or number etc. These methods can be hundreds of lines long and make up the backbone of the Javascript programming language in data manipulation

  Researched answer:



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: The "Driver" uses the keyboard to type whichever code has been agreed upon/suggested and approved by each member of the pair, while the "Navigator" is responsible for keeping the code
                moving in the right direction through advice and suggestions.

  Researched answer:



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?

  Your answer: Pair programming is fun and helps me with my skills socializing in the workplace. I look forward to the point where I am working out how to do something for the first time with someone.
                It will be interesting to see how bouncing off just one other person will help the flow and keep progress going.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration: Repetition of a set chain of events, often interacting with Javascript expressions and functions. Each time a loop iterates, it performs all its actions again.

2. Higher Order Functions: A higher order function for non-Javascript languages is a function that takes two or more arguments or a function that returns another function. In Javascript functions
                            often accept other functions as arguments as well as return them, such as the .map() function can do when used in React, so Higher Order Functions in Javascript
                            probably refers to such functions. They are very powerful logical tools for web development.

3. Jest: Jest is a modern testing library for Javascript. Notably it works with the React framework for Javascript, making it a powerful ally for developers who use TTD.

4. Classes: Classes exist in almost every programming language, and are basically factories. They exist to format and create objects, which can contain any number of data. Classes in Javascript
            have an inheritance property that allows them to borrow behavior from other classes already created before them, allowing for fluid expansion on prior ideas. Classes can be created with
            or without core attributes that are pre-defined in the class. In this way the class acts as a model for the objects it produces, namely by the "new" keyword

5. React: React is a Javascript library created by Facebook that revolutionized modern web development. It allows quick and sophisticated access to all visual and operational elements of
          a web app, and represents the technological base of many if not most of the world's most cutting edge and popular websites. In particular, its power with Hooks in ES6 makes it
          remarkably easy to navigate and control state within components.
