# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a series of rules that handle incoming information to produce a specific output. You would use one to map out behavior for your program.

  Researched answer: A function is a group of mathematical expressions that accept an input and produce an output. A function will have a consistent output given the same input. Functions in mathematics
                    and science are often used to represent the relationship between different phenomena; in programming functions are used to execute complex computation and process large
                    amounts of data in an accurate and useful manner.



2. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  Your answer: I'm not entirely sure, but I believe an argument is the data you pass into a function, whereas a parameter is data a function is using that was passed into it? Otherwise they are the same thing.

  Researched answer: Paramaters are the variables built into functions that factor in input and communication with other functions. Arguments are the actual values passed into functions to perform
                    their logic with. They describe two faces of the same coin. A parameter is theoretical, while an argument is actual.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is a location within an array. It accesses a specific node and nothing else. A value is a piece of data stored somewhere. A value could be stored at an index within an array, but they are two different types of speech in javascript.

  Researched answer: An index is a numerical value which represents a specific node in an ordered list, typically an array. It is not a value itself, but instead is a location at which a value can be
                      appropriated. A value, on the other hand, is a specific measure of a data type and is used to represent state or action within programs. Values can be changed and read by functions
                      and are stored by various manner, one of which being by index within array.



4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: A built-in method is a function that is built-in to whichever respective class it is a part of, be it string or number etc. These methods can be hundreds of lines long and make up the backbone of the Javascript programming language in data manipulation

  Researched answer: A built-in method exists as part of the programming language; it is what makes different languages good at certain things and bad at others. Built-in methods are functions that
                    are attached to certain keywords in a programming language; e.g., in Javascript the most powerful built-in methods are those for the Array datatype. These methods allow for certain
                    liberties to be assumed when processing data in their respective languages, as they can aid heavily in such an endeavor.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: The "Driver" uses the keyboard to type whichever code has been agreed upon/suggested and approved by each member of the pair, while the "Navigator" is responsible for keeping the code
                moving in the right direction through advice and suggestions.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is when two developers are partnered onto a single console/machine. The benefits of such a techique are obvious when two developers with different
                      skillsets/backgrounds are working together, as such a pair will be able to shore up their weaknesses with each others' differing expertise. The member of the pair who is not
                      currently typing is responsible for coming up with the core concepts for the project and directing the code to a structurally sound solution.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?

  Your answer: Pair programming is fun and helps me with my skills socializing in the workplace. I look forward to the point where I am working out how to do something for the first time with someone.
                It will be interesting to see how bouncing off just one other person will help the flow and keep progress going.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Iteration: Repetition of a set chain of events, often interacting with Javascript expressions and functions. Each time a loop iterates, it performs all its actions again.

2. Higher Order Functions: A higher order function for non-Javascript languages is a function that takes two or more arguments or a function that returns another function. In Javascript functions
                            often accept other functions as arguments as well as return them, such as the .map() function can do when used in React, so Higher Order Functions in Javascript
                            probably refers to such functions. They are very powerful logical tools for web development.

3. Jest: Jest is a modern testing library for Javascript. Notably it works with the React framework for Javascript, making it a powerful ally for developers who use TTD.

4. Classes: Classes exist in almost every programming language, and are basically factories. They exist to format and create objects, which can contain any number of data. Classes in Javascript
            have an inheritance property that allows them to borrow behavior from other classes already created before them, allowing for fluid expansion on prior ideas. Classes can be created with
            or without core attributes that are pre-defined in the class. In this way the class acts as a model for the objects it produces, namely by the "new" keyword

5. React: React is a Javascript library created by Facebook that revolutionized modern web development. It allows quick and sophisticated access to all visual and operational elements of
          a web app, and represents the technological base of many if not most of the world's most cutting edge and popular websites. In particular, its power with Hooks in ES6 makes it
          remarkably easy to navigate and control state within components.
